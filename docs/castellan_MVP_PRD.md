# 1. Overview

## Product Name
FlowGate

## Summary
FlowGate is a usage-based API monetization gateway that enables developers to charge for API access per request instead of relying on subscriptions or fixed-rate billing. It sits in front of existing APIs as a Go-based reverse proxy, handling authentication, request routing, metering, and billing. Each request is priced, validated against a prepaid balance, and recorded in an internal ledger, allowing precise tracking of API usage in real time.

The project solves the limitations of traditional API monetization models, which are often too rigid, inefficient, or operationally complex. Subscriptions lead to overpayment or underutilization, while free tiers are difficult to sustain. FlowGate replaces these with a proportional model where users pay exactly for what they consume, making small APIs economically viable and reducing friction for both providers and consumers.

To ensure performance and scalability, FlowGate does not execute blockchain transactions per request. Instead, it aggregates usage in an internal ledger and performs batched settlements using the Stellar network. This keeps the system fast while still enabling transparent, low-cost financial settlement.

Beyond billing, FlowGate establishes a foundation for machine-native payments, where APIs and eventually AI agents can interact economically without human intervention. Its long-term direction is to become a programmable payment layer for software systems, enabling automated, fine-grained commerce across digital services.


## MVP Scope
This MVP focuses exclusively on:

1. Phase 1 — Core Gateway Infrastructure
2. Phase 2 — Real Payment Infrastructure

The objective is to validate:
- usage-based API monetization,
- programmable request metering,
- prepaid billing flows,
- Stellar-based settlement,
- and low-friction developer onboarding.

The MVP intentionally excludes:
- AI-agent orchestration,
- marketplaces,
- decentralized governance,
- advanced cryptographic authorization,
- streaming payments,
- token economies,
- and complex pricing models.

---

# 2. MVP Goals

## Primary Goal
Enable developers to wrap existing APIs behind a gateway that:
- meters usage,
- deducts prepaid balances,
- and settles provider earnings through Stellar.

---

## Secondary Goals

### G1 — Minimal Integration Complexity
Providers should onboard APIs with minimal infrastructure changes.

### G2 — Reliable Request Accounting
All billable requests must be tracked accurately.

### G3 — Low-Latency Gatewaying
Gateway overhead should remain operationally acceptable.

### G4 — Simple Prepaid Billing
Consumers fund balances before usage.

### G5 — Batched Settlement
Provider payouts should aggregate usage efficiently.

# 8. Settlement Infrastructure (Phase 2)

# 8.1 Settlement Overview

Settlement transfers provider earnings from:
- internal ledger balances
- to Stellar wallets.

IMPORTANT:

---

# 9. Deposit Infrastructure

# 9.1 Consumer Funding Flow

```text
1. Consumer requests deposit via dashboard
2. System returns SEP-7 URI: web+stellar:pay?destination=GABC...&memo=uuid&memo_type=text
3. Dashboard renders QR code + raw address/memo
4. Consumer scans QR (wallet pre-fills destination + memo) or copy-pastes
5. Consumer sends XLM
6. Deposit watcher polls Stellar every ~5s
7. Payment matched by memo; UNIQUE tx_hash prevents replay
8. Internal ledger credited
```

---

# 9.2 Implementation Details

## Wallet Model (MVP)

Single FlowGate-operated hot wallet for receiving deposits. Memo-based routing with unique UUID per consumer — same pattern used by exchanges on Stellar.

## Minimum Deposit

5 XLM minimum threshold to prevent dust/spam attacks. Deposits below this are rejected.

## Memo Recovery

If a consumer sends XLM without a memo, the funds arrive but cannot be routed automatically. MVP handles this via manual support process: consumer provides the tx_hash, an admin verifies and credits the account.

## SEP-7 QR Code

The deposit endpoint generates a [SEP-7 URI](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0007.md) which encodes destination address, memo type, memo value, and optionally the amount. The dashboard renders this as a QR code using `qrcode.react`. Compatible wallets (LOBSTR, Solar, Freighter, xBull) pre-fill all fields when scanned — eliminating the #1 failure mode of forgotten memos.

---

# 9.3 Deposit Watcher

## Responsibilities

### Monitor Stellar Payments
Poll Stellar Horizon: `payments?for=deposit_wallet&cursor=last_seen`

### Validate by Memo + tx_hash
Skip if: already processed (UNIQUE `deposits.tx_hash`), or amount below minimum.

### Credit Internal Balances
Insert deposit record → update `accounts.balance` → write `ledger_entry`.

---

## Recommended Design

Run as independent worker service. Poll interval: ~5 seconds (Stellar finality is ~3-5s).

# 10. Dashboard Requirements

# 10.1 Provider Dashboard

## Features

### API Registration
Providers register APIs through the dashboard UI. CLI-based bulk registration and OpenAPI spec sync are deferred to Phase 3.

### Pricing Configuration
Providers set per-endpoint pricing (`price_amount`) and toggle public/private status in the dashboard. OpenAPI extensions (`x-castellan-price`, `x-castellan-public`) for one-shot setup via CLI are deferred to Phase 3.

### Usage Analytics

# 18. Known MVP Limitations

The MVP intentionally does NOT support:
- dynamic pricing,
- multi-chain payments,
- autonomous AI wallets,
- decentralized execution,
- cryptographic capability tokens,
- token streaming,
- advanced analytics,
- SLA guarantees,
- enterprise compliance.

---

# 19. Future Compatibility Considerations

Although excluded from MVP, architecture SHOULD remain extensible for:

### AI-Agent Wallets
### Delegated Spending
### Capability-Based Auth
### Streaming Billing
### Marketplace Discovery
### Machine-Readable Pricing
### Multi-Provider Routing

Avoid tightly coupling:
- identities,
- wallets,
- API keys,
- and settlement logic.

---

# 20. Final Technical Priorities

The MVP should prioritize:

1. ledger correctness,
2. accurate metering,
3. low operational complexity,
4. reliable settlement,
5. excellent developer experience,
6. extensible architecture.

Premature optimization should be avoided.

The MVP's primary purpose is validating:

> whether developers want programmable, usage-based API monetization infrastructure.
