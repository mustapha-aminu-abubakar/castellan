# PRD — Machine-Payable API Gateway Infrastructure

## Project Working Title
Castellan (working name)

---

# 1. Executive Summary

Castellan is a developer-first infrastructure platform that enables usage-based API monetization through programmable micropayments and metered access.

The system allows API providers to:
- monetize APIs per request,
- meter usage automatically,
- receive programmable payouts,
- support machine-to-machine transactions,
- and eventually power AI-agent economies.

Unlike traditional subscription billing systems, FlowGate focuses on:
- real-time usage accounting,
- automated charging,
- low-friction developer integration,
- and blockchain-backed settlement using the Stellar ecosystem.

The initial focus is:

> A lightweight API gateway that wraps existing APIs and enables per-request monetization.

Long-term, the platform evolves into:

> programmable economic middleware for software systems and AI agents.

---

# 2. Vision Statement

Enable software systems, APIs, and AI agents to transact economically with minimal friction through programmable, usage-based payment infrastructure.

---

# 3. Problem Statement

## Current API Monetization Problems

Most API providers rely on:
- monthly subscriptions,
- API keys,
- Stripe billing,
- manual invoicing,
- enterprise contracts,
- or unsustainable free tiers.

These models create several issues:

### For API Providers
- difficult billing management,
- Stripe overhead,
- abuse from free users,
- poor monetization for low-volume APIs,
- inability to monetize small utilities,
- payment restrictions in emerging markets.

### For API Consumers
- overpaying for unused plans,
- onboarding friction,
- unnecessary subscriptions,
- inability to pay proportionally to usage,
- fragmented billing systems.

### For AI Systems
- APIs are not machine-payable,
- autonomous payment flows are difficult,
- tool usage billing lacks standardization,
- no native infrastructure for economic agents.
